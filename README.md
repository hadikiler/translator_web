# 🎥 Subtitle Translator (English)

This project is a tool for translating `.srt` subtitles from any language to any language. You can use this tool to process and translate subtitle files using an AI model. With this project, you will have 200 request credits **per day** to use. 
<br>However, for certain right-to-left (RTL) languages, like Persian (Farsi), you might need to adjust the text direction in your video player to ensure the subtitles display correctly.
<br>
⚠️ **Note**: Please note that translating large subtitle files will take time, and if the file is too large, your credits may not suffice.

🔎 **Tested Languages**: The project has only been tested on "Persian" and "English" so far.

## ❓ Why Adjust Text Direction?

Most video players default to left-to-right text alignment. When using translated subtitles in RTL languages, the text might appear misaligned or difficult to read. Adjusting the text direction ensures that:

- The text is properly aligned to the right.
- Punctuation and sentence flow are displayed correctly.
